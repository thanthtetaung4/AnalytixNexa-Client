Some Logic
First add some user verification feature and password reset feature.

Sign Up
form
onSubmit => signup the user

Account
Get user from useAuth()
states => fname lname email 
Section 1
Form to change name. 
Section 2
Form to change pwd. 

Settings
Get user with useAuth()
state => user.theme
Option to change light and dark theme.

Result
get user with useAuth()
states => user.results[]
Show results and delete button to delete 
    -> use MUI table?

Files
get user with useAuth()
states => user.files[]
Show files, download and delete button
    -> use MUI table?

Extra logic ( auto delete files older than 15 days )


Analyse
Get user with useAuth()
state => user.files[], user. results[], loading, result
Drag and drop area to upload file ( only accept excel, csv)
Save button to upload to cloud and api request to server with file path var to download the uploaded file and get headers back.

( disabled before the above steps ) 
Let user choose target from the api response which will have headers.
Analyse btn to sent api request with the target and file path var. 
set loading while receiving res and navigate to result route.
